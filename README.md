# Tic-Tac-Toe Kotlin
A terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with a server and clients communicating via TCP/IP sockets; developed for the purpose of learning and testing out Kotlin and Gradle (and for fun).

To install and run on **Windows**, use `.\RunServer.bat` and `.\RunClient.bat`.

To install and run on **Linux**, use `.\RunServer` and `.\RunClient`.
