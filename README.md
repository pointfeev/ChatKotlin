# Chat Kotlin
A chat application with a server and clients communicating via TCP/IP sockets; developed for the purpose of learning and testing out Kotlin and Gradle (and for fun).

To install and run on **Windows**, use `./RunServer.bat` and `./RunClient.bat`.

To install and run on **Linux**, use `./RunServer.sh` and `./RunClient.sh`.
